# Convert polygon data into efficient format for distribution and lookup.

This project will provide series of tools to convert polygon data into binary
format and provide libraries to read and lookup the data. I expect to support Go
at first, then Rust and Python(via Rust binding).

Other repo for binary distritution might be created to provide pre-converted
data for use, via GitHub release.

## Background

This project was originally designed and implemented in the
[tzf](https://github.com/ringsaturn/tzf) project. I decided to extract the
polygon data processing into a standalone project to improve maintenance and
distribution. I aim to reuse the similar pipeline for additional data sources,
such as administrative boundaries.

The fundamental concept behind this project is to cater to server-side use
cases, which requires loading all data into memory for in-memory lookups. This
approach is not suitable for client-side use cases, where data needs to be
loaded on demand for lookups. Since I have decided to continue using Protocol
Buffers as the data format, support for random reads will not be available.

tzf/tzf-rs/tzfpy will be contined support until this project is mature enough
and I will migrate the code to use this project.
